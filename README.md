## ✦ About The Project

**Aurum Luxury** is a concept website for an exclusive resort focused on elemental purity, silence, and minimalism. The project demonstrates high-end frontend development techniques, featuring smooth scrolling, complex GSAP animations, and an atmospheric UI design.

The design language revolves around the contrast between "The Void" (Silence/Black) and "Aurum" (Gold/Light), creating a cinematic user journey.

### 🏯 Key Experiences
* **The Collection:** A horizontal scroll showcase of luxury suites (The Onyx Suite, Ivory Loft, Presidential Void).
* **Dining:** An "Omakase" culinary experience page designed with shadow and light aesthetics.
* **Wellness:** A spa section featuring thermal waters and sensory deprivation tanks ("Void Deprivation").
* **Philosophy:** Scroll-triggered text animations revealing the brand's core values.
